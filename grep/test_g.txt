This is a sample text file to test the grep utility implementation.
Searching for specific words in a large file can be a challenging task.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
This -line contains the word "search", which should be detected.
Sometimes a match may be found at the beginning, middle, or end of a -line.
Grep is commonly used in programming and system administration.
Make sure to handle edge cases, like line that are empty or contain special characters.
End of the test file. Good luck!
